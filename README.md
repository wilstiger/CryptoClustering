# CryptoClustering

This repository contains the `CryptoClustering` project, where we apply machine learning techniques like **K-Means Clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to classify cryptocurrencies based on their price fluctuations across various timeframes. The project demonstrates the use of **unsupervised learning** to identify clusters within a dataset of cryptocurrency price data, showcasing skills in data processing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and classify cryptocurrencies based on their price behavior over various timeframes, using techniques like **K-Means Clustering** and **PCA** for dimensionality reduction. By analyzing the elbow method for choosing the optimal number of clusters and using PCA to reduce the feature space, we can better understand the relationships and potential clusters within the cryptocurrency market data.

## Features

- **K-Means Clustering**: Identify optimal clusters based on the elbow method using both the original and PCA-reduced data.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduce high-dimensional data to three principal components to improve clustering performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate elbow plots to determine the best value for k and scatter plots for visualizing the clusters.
- **Feature Influence Analysis**: Examine feature weights on each principal component to understand the strongest influences.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the entire project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for K-Means clustering and PCA.
- **Matplotlib** and **hvPlot**: Data visualization libraries.

Key Sections in the Notebook
Finding the Best Value for k: Uses the elbow method on both original scaled data and PCA data.
Clustering Cryptocurrencies: Applies K-Means with the optimal k value and visualizes clusters on scatter plots.
PCA Transformation: Reduces the data to three principal components, calculates explained variance, and visualizes in reduced dimensions.
Feature Influence Analysis: Displays PCA component loadings to identify influential features.
